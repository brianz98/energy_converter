Minimal static site that converts between common units used in quantum chemistry.

Inspired [this energy converter](https://www.colby.edu/chemistry/PChem/Hartree.html), but with more units, updated conversion constants, an "energy difference mode", and more intuitive sig fig control.

You can access the live site [here](https://brianz98.github.io/energy_converter/).
