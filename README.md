# Quantum Chemistry Energy Converter

Minimal static site that converts between common units used in quantum chemistry: Hartree (Eh), eV, wavenumbers (cm⁻¹), Kelvin, kcal/mol, kJ/mol, and MHz.

Inspired [this energy converter](https://www.colby.edu/chemistry/PChem/Hartree.html), with more units, updated conversion constants, an "energy difference mode", and more intuitive sig fig control.
